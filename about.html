                    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
                    <p>At our core, Business & Software at Berkeley (BSB) is a collection of students who have a shared interest in experiential learning and an enthusiasm to apply our knowledge to the real world. The value we bring our clients is a symptom of our desire to expand our backgrounds and satisfy our curiousity.</p>
                    <p>BSB is a consulting club and a coding club—we <i>are</i> professionally oriented—but we are also a uniquely tight-knit and trusting community. This is not only a benefit for the members of our club, but also a significant edge in our consulting and coding services; our propensity towards teamwork and collaboration shows in the quality our work.</p>
                    <p>As a club providing consulting and coding services, we are industry-agnostic. We are always exploring new verticals to dive into and new businesses to work with. BSB does not specialize in a specific industry—what unites the companies we have worked with is an opportunity to strengthen their business through our consulting and software engineering services. This is the opportunity we provide our members: the privilege to sit at a buffet of industries while developing and applying one's skills as a student. We believe the rigor and frequency of new projects at BSB is what makes this opportunity unique; post-graduation, it is rare to so swiftly learn as much about as many different businesses as our members do through their experiences.</p>
