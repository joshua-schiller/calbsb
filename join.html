                            <p>It's easiest to think of the recruiting process as consisting of two segments:
                                pre-application, and post-application. </p> <br>
                            <p>The pre-application segment consists of coffee chats, info sessions, and the case
                                workshop—all things that happen before <b>our application is due on Friday 2/6, at
                                    3pm.</b></p> <br>
                            <p>The post-application segment consists of application review and the interview process.
                                After the application deadline, we begin application review, looking at the materials
                                you submitted in your application <b>and</b> considering your involvement in the
                                pre-application segment. By Friday night, we extend interviews. All applicants admitted
                                to BSB will have completed a minimum of two interviews—one group interview and one
                                individual interview. Additional interviews may be extended on a case-by-case basis.</p>

                                we don't expect you to be an expert. Many of our members have experience in both

                            <p>The scope of our work is broad, and so is the range of our clients. We've developed
                                end-to-end products for startups, delivered market expansion strategies for large
                                retailers, optimized supply-chain operations for manufacturers, and more. BSB aims to
                                expose its members to a wide breadth of work across a wide breadth of industries, so you
                                get a taste of multiple domains spread between a variety of verticles.</p>

                                session and the case workshop, have a coffee chat with a staff member, and send in the
                                application. We intentionally make our application quick to fill out because we don't
                                want you spending a ton of time on the application process.</p> <br>
                            <p>Be yourself. There isn't a specific applicant profile we filter for, and we discourage
                                applicants from trying to fit a type of mold that they believe will increase their
                                chances of admission. We do think it's really cool when someone is visibly authentic.

                            <p>A “coffee chat” is a 15-30 minute conversation between you and a BSB staff member. Coffee
                                chats allow applicants to gain a better understanding of BSB—our culture, our
                                organizational objectives, and what we have in store for upcoming semester—and also help
                                us learn more about you, putting a face to a name. While coffee chats are casual in
                                nature, we encourage you to think about how you want to direct the conversation, ahead
                                of time. In other words, we can tell when you come prepared and we remember it when
                                we're reviewing applications. That being said, coffee chats are not required to apply.

                            <p>We <b>highly encourage</b> “double coffee chats”—instead of the coffee chat involving
                                only you and a BSB staff member, bring a friend! We find that a three-person
                                conversation lessens any pressure and lightens the mild awkwardness that comes with
                                meeting new people.</p> <br>
                            <p>For Spring 2026, we're limiting the number of coffee chats per applicant to <b>one</b>,
                                including if you signed up for or took part in a double coffee chat.</p>

                            <p><b>Info Session 2</b>: 2/4, 8-10pm, VLSB2060</p> <br>
                            <p><b>Case Workshop</b>: 2/5, 8-10pm, SOCS60</p> <br>
                            <p>We recommend most applicants attend one of the two info sessions, as well as the case
                                workshop. Our info sessions cover BSB's background, staff member introductions, and
                                application tips. Our case workshop prepares applicants for our consulting interviews—we
                                go over a mock case that would be expected in one of our interviews and we guide our
                                attendees through solving it, which is a fantastic way to practice for the actual
                                interviews. If you're a purely technical applicant or an applicant that is only
                                interested in coding work, there's no need to attend the case workshop.</p>
